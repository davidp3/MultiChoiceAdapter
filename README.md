davidp3: Minor changes to MultiChoiceAdapter, mostly to make it a little more
versatile and to make it play more nicely with (my version of) HoloEverywhere.


MultiChoiceAdapter
==================

MultiChoiceAdapter is an implementation of ListAdapter which adds support for modal multiple choice selection as in the native Gmail app. 

It provides a functionality similar to that of the [<tt>CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL</tt>][1] ListView mode, with two additional benefits:

* It's easier to use, as it keeps count of the selected items, updates their background accordingly and handles checkboxes transparently.
* It is compatible with every version of Android from 2.x. Of course, this implies that your project must use [ActionBarSherlock][2].

![Example Image][3]

Try out the sample application:

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manuelpeinado.multichoiceadapter.demo">
  <img alt="Android app on Google Play"
       src="https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png" />
</a>

Or browse the [source code of the sample application][5] for a complete example of use.

Including in your project
-------------------------

If youâ€™re using Eclipse with the ADT plugin you can include MultiChoiceAdapter as a library project. Create a new Android project using the library/ folder as the existing source. Then, open the properties of this new project and, in the 'Android' category, add a reference to the ActionBarSherlock library project. Finally, in your application project properties, add a reference to the created library project.

If you use maven to build your Android project you can simply add a dependency for this library.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.manuelpeinado.multichoiceadapter</groupId>
    <artifactId>multichoiceadapter</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.4</version>
    <type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
```

Usage
---------

Check any of the provided tutorials:

* [Using MultiChoiceArrayAdapter][8]
* [Using MultiChoiceBaseAdapter][9]
* [Using MultiChoiceSimpleCursorAdapter][10]
* [Usage with GridView][11]

Customization
---------------------
You can customize the way the adapter behaves when an item is clicked and **the action mode was already active**. To do so, add an item named <tt>multiChoiceAdapterStyle</tt> to your theme, and have it reference an additional style which you define like this:

```xml
<style name="MyCustomMultiChoiceAdapter">
    <item name="itemClickInActionMode">selectItem</item>
</style>
```
    
Two values are supported:

* <tt>selectItem</tt>. Changes the selection state of the clicked item, just as if it had been long clicked. This is what the native MULTICHOICE_MODAL mode of ListView does, and what almost every app does, and thus the default value.
* <tt>openItem</tt>. Opens the clicked item, just as if it had been clicked outside of the action mode. This is what the native Gmail app does.


Libraries used
--------------------

* [ActionBarSherlock][2] by Jake Wharton
* The sample app uses the [ProviGen library][6] by Timothee Jeannin

Who's using it
--------------
* [My App List][7]. With this app you can save installed applications in a list to restore them after flash or install a new ROM.
